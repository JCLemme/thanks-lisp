It occurred to me that I'm Old and I've never implemented a Lisp before[^1]. How embarassing

Well, off to fix that. Two days later and here is that Lisp. It's a mess (first time jitters) but yet:

* Working lambdas
* Garbage collection
* Tagbodies
* Lexical scoping
* Macros
* Usually doesn't segfault

~~The goal is to see how much I can get done before Thanksgiving, at which point I'll **throw it all away** and start over.~~

On a winning streak and didn't want to stop. New goal is christmas?
