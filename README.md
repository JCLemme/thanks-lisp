# thanks

It occurred to me that I'm Old and I've never implemented a Lisp before. How embarassing

Well, off to fix that. Two days later and here is that Lisp. It's a mess (first time jitters) but yet:

* Working lambdas
* Garbage collection
* Preliminary support for macros
* Usually doesn't segfault

The goal is to see how much I can get done before Thanksgiving, at which point I'll **throw it all away** and start over.
